blinding
:   A cryptographic technique  by which an agent can provide a service to
    (i.e., compute a function for) a client in an encoded form without
    knowing either the real input or the real output.

blind signature
:   A form of digital signature in which the content of a message is
    disguised (blinded) before it is signed, so that the signer never sees
    the original, unblinded message. The resulting blind signature can be
    publicly verified against the unblinded message in the manner of a
    regular digital signature.
